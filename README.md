# Stanford cs231 / cs231n assignments
Solved Homework assignments for the 'Convolutional Neural Nets for Visual Recognition' (CS231n) Course by Andrej Karpathy and Fei-Fei-Li - September 2016

This one was a pretty tough course. We only had 3 weeks of vacations between our final exams and uni, so trying to 
get done with this course was definitely a challenge. I was not able to debug the LSTM model, while the RNN model 
did fine for its capacity. I also was not able to program the adversarial and generative models and will leave 
task to some future chunk of free-time, which will probably take some time as I got interested in David Silver's 
Reinforcement Learning Course and still have to cope with other projects/responsibilities. 
This was the most challenging course I've taken so far, but it was also one of the (
if not the most) valuable one. I often needed external help, which I got mainly through other people's code or 
online-communities, but it has made me a better coder being able to take up even bigger challenges now (such as the RL course).
Consider working on these assignments if you've had a short introduction to neural 
nets!
